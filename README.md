# Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This script is done for merge and prepare for a posterior analysis the open data provided by the UCI Machine Learn Repository, created and provided as open source by:

"Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013."

The data is procesed and transformed according the assingment proposed in the course Getting and Cleaning Data of Coursera.

The scrip is writed to get the dataset: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

And perform the nexts steps: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity    and each subject.

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
